                  Stumble and fall walking on even ground,
                  Wander off the road and no miss-step to found,
                  Yet the well trodden road is the one I am bound,
                  So why is it so, to trip on even ground?
                  Only for a little is all that I ask,
                  Yet the difficulties linger in the simplest of task,
                  So why don't I roll over...

                  Words cannot express,
                  Feelings I won't suppress,
                  Don't seem to exist,
                  Or I'm just too pissed.
                  Lost in those globes,
                  Trying to swim,
                  But those awesome waves,
                  They keep me in.
                  What happened to my eyes,
                  My open ears confuse,
                  Too many words abuse,
                  Distinction of lies or truths .
                  Lost in those globes....

                Chorus#
                Moments of despair,
                Dashed with elation,
                What the fuzzy,
                Fuzzy Duck,
                Is going on in this nation?
                #End Chorus
                So much beauty,
                To behold, awe
                Lost in a notion,
                To settle, score.
                All these games played,
                Becoming a bore,
                Is the time to exit,
                Leave through the door.

                How did it ever come to this ,
                From such a feeling of bliss,
                Life's most magical gift,
                Now one struggles even to lift,
                To hold your head up high,
                And look up toward the sky,
                Why would you even want to fly?
                The love that you've born.
                Fallen to thier scorn,
                What is it that you desire,
                To throw others on a pire,
                For your own failure to see...

                In conjunction with all this dysfunction,
                What is it that we be and why is it we cannot see,
                The traces of our steps taken, always leaving us forsaken
                Or is it I, little I that is mistaken.
                Misguided to believe, that we are destined to breath,
                Not drowning in the shadows but lifted as sparrows,
                Daydreaming they say, for you must, you MUST play...
